Because all irc servers have some unbelievable cool ascii art, here is irce's:

                           _____ _____   _____
                          |_   _|  __ \ / ____|
                            | | | |__) | |     ___
                            | | |  _  /| |    / _ \
                           _| |_| | \ \| |___|  __/
                          |_____|_|  \_\\_____\___|
                                Erlang IRCd

Pay special attention to the two letter cases which were combined here in an
easy and stunning way: the first three letters (I, R, C) are in capital letters
while the e (for Erlang) is in lower case. Now this can even be spoken!!1! Like
Adobe, but "IRC" has (in contrast to "Adob") a special meaning. Wow, must be an
outstanding server. Or is there another ircd which can be compared to 
Adobe and even wins the battle for the deeper meaning of the name, because 
servers are at least 14 times cooler than streams.
No, there is'nt. Trust me.

If you see this, the guy who started this server has not changed this stupid
Message Of The Day yet. Maybe send some mails, might help to
avoid further laziness. Or show that you can change it, even without being
admin or having physical access to it. Stay clean.
